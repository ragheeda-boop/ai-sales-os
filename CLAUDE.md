# AI Sales OS — CLAUDE.md

## Identity & Role

You are the **RevOps Architect & Data Pipeline Operator** for AI Sales OS.
This is a production-grade Sales Operating System, not a hobby project.

**System:** Apollo.io → Python Engine → Notion CRM → GitHub Actions → Odoo (future)
**Owner:** Ragheed
**Version:** 6.1 | April 2026 | Modular Architecture + Company-Centric Operating Model + Phase 3.5 Complete + Live Dashboard + Outcome Tracker + Safe Execution Order + Stage Conflict Guards + Freshness Guard

---

## System Architecture

```
Apollo.io (Data)  ──►  Python Engine (8 modules)  ──►  Notion (CRM Hub)  ──►  GitHub Actions (Daily + Weekly)
  45,086 contacts         Core / Scoring /               7 Databases            7:00 AM KSA
  15,407 companies        Automation / Governance /      HOT/WARM/COLD          2-job pipeline + weekly calibration
                          Enrichment / Meetings /        Live Sales Dashboard   Sales_Dashboard_Accounts.html
                          Monitoring / Webhooks          Primary/Supporting Owners
                          (26 active scripts)            Company Stage Machine
Additional Pipelines: pipelines/muqawil/ (contractors) + pipelines/engineering_offices/ (ministry offices) + pipelines/file_sync/
```

**Company-Centric Model (v5.0):** Company = Primary Entity. ONE task per company. ONE opportunity per company. Primary Owner = most contacts. Company Stage state machine: Prospect → Outreach → Engaged → Meeting → Opportunity → Customer → Churned → Archived.

**Autonomous Sales Loop:** Score → Task → Auto-Sequence → Track Results → Outcome → Meet → Analyze → Opportunity → Calibrate → Better Score

**Key design decision:** NO middleware. No n8n, no Make.com, no Zapier. Pure Python + GitHub Actions = full control, zero cost.

## core/daily_sync.py — Sync Engine v4.0 (Company-Centric)

### Three Modes

| Mode | Usage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--mode incremental` | Daily use | Last N hours (default 24h). GitHub Actions uses `--hours 26` for overlap. |
| `--mode backfill` | Gap recovery | Historical range with checkpoint. Resumes from `backfill_checkpoint.json` if interrupted. |
| `--mode full` | First-time / rebuild | ALL records. Alphabetical A-Z partitioning to handle Apollo's 50K pagination limit. |

### Key Technical Details

- **Triple Dedup:** Apollo ID → Email → in-memory `seen_ids` set. No duplicates possible.
- **Pre-loading:** Loads ALL existing Notion records into memory before sync to minimize API calls.
- **Alphabetical Partitioning (full mode):** Splits queries A-Z + numbers because Apollo caps at 50,000 results per search.
- **Seniority Normalization:** Uses `SENIORITY_NORMALIZE` dict from core/constants.py to unify "C-Suite"/"C suite"/"c-suite" variants.
- **Safe Boolean Writing:** Only writes engagement checkboxes (Email Sent, Replied, etc.) if Apollo explicitly returns the field — prevents overwriting manual True with False.
- **Rate Limiting:** 5x exponential backoff on 429/500 errors.
- **Parallel Workers:** `MAX_WORKERS = 3` for Notion writes.
- **Local Timestamp Filter (v4.2):** After Apollo fetch, a client-side filter drops any record whose `updated_at` is before the requested `since` datetime. Fixes issue where Apollo's date-only API filter was returning all 44,877 contacts on every incremental run, causing 4-5 hour runtimes instead of minutes.
- **Contact Qualification Filter (v4.4):** After fetching contacts, applies two hard gates before sync: (1) `owner_id` must exist, (2) `emailer_campaign_ids` must be non-empty with at least one non-failed campaign. Contacts that fail either condition are skipped entirely. This ensures only real, owned, outreached contacts enter Notion.
- **Contact Owner Sync (v4.4):** Maps Apollo `owner_id` to display names (Ibrahim/Ragheed/Soha) via `APOLLO_OWNER_MAP` in core/constants.py. Writes to `Contact Owner` field in Notion as **rich_text** (not select). The Notion schema shows it as select, but core/daily_sync.py writes it via `_rt()` (rich_text helper).
- **Company Ownership (v5.1 — Apollo-First):** After contact sync, runs `compute_company_ownership(contacts, company_lookup, accounts=accounts)` with priority logic: **(1)** if the Apollo Account has `owner_id` → mapped via `APOLLO_OWNER_MAP` becomes Primary Company Owner and Supporting Owners is cleared (Apollo is authoritative); **(2)** otherwise falls back to v5.0 contact-based logic (owner with most contacts, tie-break: most recent activity → Primary; others → Supporting). Unknown `owner_id` values log a warning and drop to fallback. Writes Primary Company Owner as select, Supporting Owners as rich_text. See Decision #27.
- **Company Metrics (v5.0):** `compute_company_metrics()` writes Active Contacts count, Emailed Contacts count, Engaged Contacts count, Last Engagement Date, and Sales OS Active checkbox per company.
- **Company Stage (v5.0):** `compute_company_stage()` derives stage from contact signals: Meeting Booked → "Meeting", Replied/Opened → "Engaged", Email Sent → "Outreach", else → "Prospect". Respects priority — does NOT overwrite Meeting, Opportunity, Customer, or Churned stages.
- **Apollo Signals (v4.3):** Contacts sync now pulls Intent Strength, Job Change Event/Date, and AI Decision from `typed_custom_fields`. Companies sync now pulls Headcount Growth (6/12/24 month) and AI Qualification Status/Detail from `typed_custom_fields`.

### Commands

```bash
python core/daily_sync.py --mode incremental --days 7    # last 7 days
python core/daily_sync.py --mode backfill --days 365      # full year with checkpoint
python core/daily_sync.py --mode full                     # everything (2-4 hours)
python core/daily_sync.py                                 # defaults to incremental --hours 24
```

## scoring/lead_score.py — Scoring Engine

Now writes **Lead Score** (0-100), **Lead Tier** (HOT/WARM/COLD select), and **Sort Score** in a single update.

### Formula (v1.5 — current calibrated weights)

```
Score = (Intent × 10%) + (Engagement × 10%) + (Company Size × 35%) + (Seniority × 30%) + (Industry Fit × 15%)
Sort Score = (Lead Score × 100) + Recency Bonus (0-100)
```

**v1.5 changes from v1.1:** Added Industry Fit (15%) — MUHIDE ICP alignment. Reduced Size 45%→35%, Seniority 35%→30%.

**Sort Score purpose:** Breaks the 56% ceiling effect (HOT leads all at 100/100). Sort by `Sort Score DESC` in Notion HOT views — untouched leads (never contacted) surface first, recently contacted leads drop to bottom within the same score tier.

**Industry Fit Score:** Defined in `ICP_INDUSTRY_SCORES` in scoring/constants.py. Financial Services/Banking/FinTech = 100, Retail/Entertainment = 15-20, Unknown = 30.

**Why these weights?** Most contacts are cold Apollo data with no outreach history. Intent and Engagement are mostly empty, so giving them high weight would make scores meaninglessly low. Size, Seniority, and Industry are available for nearly all records and provide the best signal right now.

### Future v2.0 weights (activate ONLY when signals data exists)

```
Score = (Intent × 30%) + (Engagement × 25%) + (Signals × 25%) + (Size × 10%) + (Seniority × 10%)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT switch to v2.0 weights until job postings, job change, and intent trend data are actually populated. Giving 25% weight to empty fields would weaken all scores.

### Lead Classification

**NOTE:** The code implements exactly 3 tiers. WARM-HIGH was removed — the code uses HOT/WARM/COLD only.

| Tier | Score | Task Type | Action | SLA |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|-----|
| **HOT** | ≥ 80 | Urgent Call | Call today — high-value decision makers | 24 hours |
| **WARM** | ≥ 50 | Follow-up | Follow up via email | 48 hours |
| **COLD** | < 50 | — | No action — monitor only | — |

### Expected Calibration Targets

- HOT: 0.5–2% of total contacts
- WARM: 10–20%
- COLD: 80%+ (normal for cold Apollo data — this is expected, not a problem)

### Commands

```bash
python scoring/lead_score.py                # score unscored contacts only
python scoring/lead_score.py --force        # recalculate ALL scores
python scoring/lead_score.py --dry-run      # calculate but don't write
```

---

## automation/auto_tasks.py — Action Engine v2.0 (Company-Centric)

Creates Notion tasks at the **company level** for Action Ready contacts. ONE task per company per tier, not one per contact.

### Priority Rules

| Tier | Min Score | Priority | Task Type | Action | Channel | SLA |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|-----|
| **HOT** | ≥ 80 | Critical | **Urgent Call** | CALL | Phone | 24 hours |
| **WARM** | ≥ 50 | High | **Follow-up** | FOLLOW-UP | Email | 48 hours |

**IMPORTANT:** HOT uses task_type = "Urgent Call" and WARM uses "Follow-up". These MUST be different so company-level dedup does not block HOT tasks when a WARM task already exists for the same company. (Fixed in C-03.)

### Company-Centric Rules (v5.0)

- **ONE task per company per task type** — contacts are grouped by company, best-scored contact selected as primary
- **Task Owner** = Primary Company Owner (from Companies DB) → fallback to Contact Owner
- **Owner Source** field tracks provenance: "Company Primary" or "Contact Owner"
- **Company context** in task description shows all contacts at the company with scores
- **Company Stage at Creation** recorded for audit trail

### Duplicate Prevention

Before creating a task, checks the Tasks DB for any existing open task (Status ≠ "Completed") linked to the same **company** with the same task type. If one exists, the company is skipped.

### Commands

```bash
python automation/auto_tasks.py                    # create tasks for all Action Ready contacts
python automation/auto_tasks.py --dry-run          # show what would be created
python automation/auto_tasks.py --limit 20         # limit to first N contacts (testing)
python automation/auto_tasks.py --mark-overdue     # only check and log overdue tasks
```

---

## scoring/action_ready_updater.py — Action Ready Evaluator

Evaluates and writes the `Action Ready` checkbox for all scored contacts. A contact is Action Ready ONLY if ALL 5 conditions are met:

1. Lead Score >= 50
2. Do Not Call = False
3. Outreach Status NOT in {Do Not Contact, Bounced, Bad Data}
4. Stage is NOT "Customer" or "Churned"
5. Has at least one contact method (email or phone)

### Commands

```bash
python scoring/action_ready_updater.py              # update all scored contacts
python scoring/action_ready_updater.py --dry-run    # show what would change
```

---

## monitoring/health_check.py — Pipeline Health Validator

Runs after the pipeline to validate results by checking stats JSON files.

### Checks

- **CRITICAL:** Zero records processed (sync may have failed)
- **WARNING:** High duplicate rate (>5%)
- **WARNING:** Failed records in sync
- **WARNING:** Action Engine errors
- **INFO:** Zero tasks created (all contacts may already have open tasks)

### Commands

```bash
python monitoring/health_check.py              # run all checks
python monitoring/health_check.py --strict     # exit 1 on any warning (not just critical)
```

Uses Apollo's Job Postings API as a proxy for Intent Score. Companies that are actively hiring in relevant roles = higher buying intent.

### Scoring Components (0-100)
- **Job Volume (0-40):** Number of open positions
- **Recency (0-20):** How recently jobs were posted
- **Relevance (0-25):** Keywords matching our solution areas (insurance, risk, compliance, finance, etc.)
- **Growth Signals (0-15):** Hiring across multiple departments

Writes `Job Postings Intent` to Companies DB, then propagates to linked Contacts' `Primary Intent Score`. Uses 7-day cache to avoid redundant API calls.

### Commands

```bash
python enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py                    # enrich all HOT/WARM companies
python enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py --dry-run          # preview without writing
python enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py --limit 20         # limit to first N companies
python enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py --tier HOT         # only HOT companies
python enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py --no-cache         # ignore 7-day cache
```

## automation/auto_sequence.py — Auto Sequence Enrollment (v4.0)

Automatically enrolls Action Ready contacts into Apollo Sequences based on Lead Tier + Role category. Round-robins between senders.

### Sequence Mapping

Maps (Tier, Role) → specific Apollo sequence. Role detection uses seniority + title keywords to classify contacts as: CEO, CFO, Sales, Legal, or General.

### Sender Round-Robin

Alternates between `ragheed` and `ibrahim` email accounts (2 accounts each: joinmuhide.com + ratlfintech.com/muhide.com).

### Safety

- Skips contacts already "In Sequence"
- Skips DNC and blocked outreach statuses
- Updates Notion `Outreach Status → "In Sequence"` after enrollment
- Default limit of 50 per run in pipeline

### Commands

```bash
python automation/auto_sequence.py                     # enroll all eligible contacts
python automation/auto_sequence.py --dry-run           # preview without enrolling
python automation/auto_sequence.py --limit 10          # limit to first N
python automation/auto_sequence.py --tier HOT          # only HOT contacts
python automation/auto_sequence.py --sender ragheed    # force specific sender
```

## enrichment/analytics_tracker.py — Analytics & Engagement Sync (v4.0)

Pulls Apollo Analytics data and syncs engagement signals back to Notion contacts. Closes the feedback loop by bringing real engagement data into the CRM.

### What It Does

1. **Engagement Sync:** Checks contacts in active outreach (In Sequence, Sent, Opened) and updates Notion booleans (Replied, Email Opened, Email Sent) from Apollo data
2. **Analytics Report:** Generates performance reports broken down by seniority, company size, and weekly trends

### Commands

```bash
python enrichment/analytics_tracker.py                    # full sync + report
python enrichment/analytics_tracker.py --dry-run          # preview without writing
python enrichment/analytics_tracker.py --days 7           # last N days
python enrichment/analytics_tracker.py --export           # save report to file
python enrichment/analytics_tracker.py --skip-sync        # report only, no Notion writes
```

---

## scoring/score_calibrator.py — Self-Learning Weights (v4.0)

Analyzes actual engagement outcomes and recommends weight adjustments for scoring/lead_score.py. The feedback loop: Score → Action → Outcome → Calibrate → Better Score.

### Safety Rails

- `MAX_WEIGHT_CHANGE = 0.10` per cycle (no sudden jumps)
- `MIN_WEIGHT = 0.05` (no component goes to zero)
- `MIN_EMAILS_FOR_CALIBRATION = 100` (need enough data)
- Saves full history in `calibration_history.json`
- Never auto-applies unless `--apply` flag is explicitly used

### Commands

```bash
python scoring/score_calibrator.py                  # analyze + recommend (no changes)
python scoring/score_calibrator.py --apply          # apply recommended weights
python scoring/score_calibrator.py --days 90        # analyze last 90 days
python scoring/score_calibrator.py --export         # save analysis to file
```

**IMPORTANT:** Weekly pipeline runs calibrator in review-only mode (no --apply). Manual review required before applying.

---

## monitoring/morning_brief.py — Daily Intelligence Report (v4.0)

Generates a daily morning brief with everything a sales rep needs to know.

### Sections

1. **Urgent Calls:** HOT leads not yet contacted
2. **Today's Tasks:** Due today + overdue
3. **Recent Replies:** Contacts that responded
4. **Pipeline Summary:** HOT/WARM/COLD counts
5. **Email Performance:** Last 7 days from Apollo Analytics

### Commands

```bash
python monitoring/morning_brief.py                 # generate today's brief (stdout)
python monitoring/morning_brief.py --output file   # save to markdown file
python monitoring/morning_brief.py --days 1        # look back N days for activity
```

## core/constants.py — Unified Constants

Single source of truth for all field names, score thresholds, SLA hours, and seniority normalization. Changing a field name here changes it across all scripts that import from core/constants.

Key exports: `FIELD_*` constants, `SCORE_HOT`/`SCORE_WARM`, `SLA_*_HOURS`, `SENIORITY_NORMALIZE`, `OUTREACH_BLOCKED`, `COMPANY_STAGE_*` values, `TEAM_MEMBERS` set, `APOLLO_OWNER_MAP`

**Intent helpers (v6.1 — Decision #28):** `has_real_intent(record) → (bool, [reasons])`, `company_has_real_intent(contacts) → (bool, [reasons])`, `EMAIL_OPEN_COUNT_INTENT_THRESHOLD = 2`, `INTENT_REASON_*` labels, `FIELD_INTERNAL_FORWARD_DETECTED`, `FIELD_REPEATED_ENGAGEMENT_DETECTED`, `FIELD_HAS_INTENT_SIGNAL`.

**Stage conflict guards (v6.1 — Decision #29):** `STAGE_PRIORITY` lattice (Prospect=1 → Archived=8), `STAGE_TERMINAL = {Customer, Churned, Archived}`, `is_stage_regression(current, new) → bool`. Unknown current stage is treated as priority 0 (never blocks forward progress).

**Freshness guard (v6.1 — Decision #29):** `FRESHNESS_MAX_AGE_HOURS = 26`, `FRESHNESS_STATS_FILES = (enrichment/last_analytics_stats.json, automation/last_outcome_stats.json, meetings/last_meeting_tracker_stats.json)`, `check_pipeline_freshness(base_dir, max_age_hours) → {fresh, checked, oldest_age_hours, max_age_hours}`. Used by `data_governor` as Step 0 of `run()` — downgrades enforce→dry-run on stale signals.

Linked database view blocks must be inserted manually in Notion UI (API cannot create linked view blocks); the page contains HTML comment placeholders with the exact spec for each view.

### Other Databases

Activities, Email Hub — used for execution workflow.

---

## Primary Key Rules (CRITICAL)

- **Companies:** Primary Key = `Apollo Account ID`. Validation = `Domain`.
- **Contacts:** Primary Key = `Apollo Contact ID`. Validation = `Email`.
- NEVER create duplicates if Apollo ID exists — ALWAYS update.
- NEVER match based on name only.

---

## Data Rules

1. **Never overwrite manual data.** Fields like Owner, Status, Notes, Stage — if manually edited, Apollo data must not overwrite them.
2. **Update only missing or dynamic fields.** Empty fields, engagement data, intent scores, last contacted.
3. **No orphan contacts.** Every contact MUST be linked to a company. If no company found: log as orphan, do NOT create.
4. **Companies before Contacts.** Company sync must complete before contact sync.
5. **No invented data.** Never guess or fabricate values for empty fields.
6. **No unowned contacts.** Every contact synced MUST have an Apollo owner_id. Contacts without owners are filtered before sync.
7. **No untouched contacts.** Every contact synced MUST have been enrolled in at least one email campaign with a non-failed status. Raw Apollo data with no outreach is not synced.
8. **Company Owners = derived.** Company Owners multi-select is computed from Contact Owners, NOT from Apollo Account owner_id (which is usually null).

---

## GitHub Actions Pipeline (v3.1 — Safe Execution Order)

**File:** `.github/workflows/daily_sync.yml`
**Schedule:** Daily at 7:00 AM KSA (04:00 UTC)
**Version:** 3.1 (Safe Execution Order — Decision #29)

### Why 2 Jobs?
The pipeline was exceeding GitHub's 6-hour per-job limit. Splitting into 2 sequential jobs gives each its own 6-hour clock — total capacity: ~9 hours.

### Safe Execution Order (Decision #29)
All signal-writing scripts (analytics_tracker, outcome_tracker, meeting_tracker, opportunity_manager) must run **before** `lead_score` + `action_ready_updater` so scoring reads fresh engagement and stage data, not yesterday's values.

### Job 1: `sync-and-score` — timeout 5h 50min (Sync → Signals → Score)
1. Checkout repository
2. Setup Python 3.11 with pip cache
3. Install dependencies
4. `python scripts/core/daily_sync.py --mode incremental --hours 26` (sync; `compute_company_stage` now guarded by `STAGE_TERMINAL` + `is_stage_regression`)
5. `python scripts/enrichment/analytics_tracker.py --days 7` (**moved up** — writes `email_open_count`, Replied, Email Opened before scoring reads them, continue-on-error)
6. `python scripts/automation/outcome_tracker.py --execute` (**moved up** — writes Contact Responded, Last Contacted, Meeting Booked, continue-on-error)
7. `python scripts/meetings/meeting_tracker.py --days 7` (**moved up** — Company Stage → Meeting, guarded, continue-on-error)
8. `python scripts/meetings/opportunity_manager.py` (**moved up** — Company Stage → Opportunity, now guarded by `STAGE_TERMINAL` + `is_stage_regression`, continue-on-error)
9. `python scripts/enrichment/job_postings_enricher.py --limit 50` (intent proxy, continue-on-error)
10. `python scripts/scoring/lead_score.py` (recalculate scores — now reads fresh signals from steps 5–8)
11. `python scripts/scoring/action_ready_updater.py` (evaluate Action Ready)
12. Upload sync stats as artifact → passed to Job 2 (expanded: analytics, outcome, meeting_tracker, opportunity_manager stats + logs all included so next-day freshness check works)

### Job 2: `action-and-track` — timeout 3h (Action → Sequence → Meet-AI → Health)
1. Checkout + Python setup + Install dependencies
2. Download sync stats from Job 1
3. `python scripts/automation/auto_tasks.py` (create tasks for Action Ready contacts, continue-on-error)
4. `python scripts/automation/auto_sequence.py --limit 50` (enroll contacts in sequences, continue-on-error)
5. `python scripts/meetings/meeting_analyzer.py --limit 10` (AI meeting intelligence, non-blocking — does not feed scoring, requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
6. `python scripts/monitoring/health_check.py` (validate pipeline run)
7. (Frozen Operator-First v2.0) `morning_brief`, `dashboard_generator`, dashboard commit — unchanged
8. Upload all logs as artifacts (30-day retention)
9. Notify on failure

**Moved from Job 2 → Job 1:** analytics_tracker, outcome_tracker, meeting_tracker, opportunity_manager. **Removed from Job 2** (no longer run twice). meeting_analyzer stays in Job 2 because it's AI-only and does not feed scoring.

**Weekly Job (Sundays):** `python scripts/scoring/score_calibrator.py --days 30 --export` — runs after Job 2, review-only, no auto-apply.

**Required Secrets:** `APOLLO_API_KEY`, `NOTION_API_KEY`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CONTACTS`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_COMPANIES`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_TASKS`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_MEETINGS`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID_OPPORTUNITIES`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional)

**Manual trigger:** Available from GitHub UI with mode selection (incremental / backfill_week / backfill_month / full), plus toggles for `run_lead_score`, `run_action_engine`, `run_sequences`.

**Cost:** Free. GitHub Actions free tier = 2,000 min/month. Daily run ≈ 30 min × 30 = 900 min/month.

## governance/archive_unqualified.py — Contact Archiver (v4.4)

One-time (or periodic) script to archive Notion contacts that don't meet qualification criteria. Reads ALL contacts from Notion Contacts DB, checks for Contact Owner and Email Sent, and sets Stage = "Archived" for those that fail.

### Commands

```bash
python governance/archive_unqualified.py              # archive all unqualified contacts
python governance/archive_unqualified.py --dry-run    # show what would be archived (no changes)
python governance/archive_unqualified.py --limit 50   # limit to first N contacts
```

**IMPORTANT:** Run `--dry-run` first to verify the count before archiving. This operation is reversible (you can un-archive by changing Stage back) but affects many records.

---

## governance/data_governor.py — Data Governor (v6.1)

Enforces data governance rules on ALL existing Notion records. Companion to `governance/ingestion_gate.py` — while the gate blocks bad data at entry, the governor cleans up what already exists.

### What It Does

1. **Step 0 — Freshness Guard (v6.1):** calls `check_pipeline_freshness()` before any audit. If upstream signal stats (`analytics_tracker`, `outcome_tracker`, `meeting_tracker`) are older than 26h or missing, and enforce mode was requested, **auto-downgrades to dry-run** and logs `[Timing Guard] Refusing to archive on possibly-stale engagement data`. Prevents false-positive archival on days where the analytics pipeline failed.
2. Builds per-company real-intent aggregation via `company_has_real_intent()` (Decision #28) — used by the Archive Guard below.
3. Audits companies and contacts against ingestion gate criteria.
4. **Archive Guard (v6.1):** any company/contact with real intent is spared archival even if it has soft failures (no_outreach, no_owner). Hard failures (no_company, no_email) still archive contacts.
5. Archives records that fail (sets Stage = "Archived").
6. Enforces Company-Contact linking (no orphan contacts).
7. Enforces Owner assignment (no unowned companies).
8. Generates a full data quality report including `companies_saved_by_intent` and `contacts_saved_by_intent` counters.
9. Soft-delete only — never hard-deletes active records.

### Commands

```bash
python governance/data_governor.py --dry-run          # audit only, no changes
python governance/data_governor.py --enforce          # apply archival + enforcement
python governance/data_governor.py --report           # generate detailed quality report
python governance/data_governor.py --enforce --limit 100  # limit to first N records
```

---

## governance/ingestion_gate.py — Ingestion Gate (v6.0)

Validates companies and contacts before they enter the system. Prevents junk data at source.

### Company Gate (must pass ≥ 2 of 5 criteria)

1. ICP Match (industry + country + size)
2. Has Senior Contact (C-Suite/VP/Director)
3. Has Intent Signal (email open/reply/meeting)
4. Has Trigger Event (funding/headcount growth/hiring)
5. Has been contacted (email sent / meeting / call)

### Contact Gate (must pass ALL 4)

1. Linked to a company in the system
2. Has valid email
3. Has clear role (Decision Maker / Influencer / End User)
4. Has an owner assigned

### Commands

```bash
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --dry-run           # evaluate without writing (audit mode)
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --mode strict       # apply gate decisions (strict enforcement)
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --enforce           # alias for --mode strict (same effect)
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --mode review       # pass gate+low-data records for review
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --report            # save detailed gate report to JSON
python governance/ingestion_gate.py --limit 50          # limit to first N companies
```

## enrichment/muhide_strategic_analysis.py — MUHIDE Strategic Analysis Engine

AI-powered analysis of all companies in Notion against MUHIDE's B2B trade governance and financing value proposition. Uses Claude API to generate a strategic fit assessment for each company.

### Output Fields (written to Companies DB)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| MUHIDE Strategic Analysis | rich_text | Full AI-generated analysis |
| MUHIDE Fit Score | number (1-100) | Strategic fit score |
| MUHIDE Priority | select (P1/P2/P3) | Outreach priority tier |
| MUHIDE Best Buyer | select | Ideal buyer persona at this company |
| MUHIDE Outreach Angle | rich_text | Recommended first approach/hook |

### Commands

```bash
python enrichment/muhide_strategic_analysis.py            # process all companies
python enrichment/muhide_strategic_analysis.py --dry-run  # preview without writing
python enrichment/muhide_strategic_analysis.py --limit 50 # process first N only
python enrichment/muhide_strategic_analysis.py --resume   # resume from checkpoint
```

Uses `muhide_analysis_checkpoint.json` to resume after interruptions. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

---

## automation/outcome_tracker.py — Task → Contact Outcome Loop (v1.0)

Closes the feedback loop between completed Tasks and their linked Contacts. For every real completed task (not auto-closed bulk tasks), it updates the contact record to reflect what actually happened.

### What It Does

For each completed task:
1. **Contact Responded** → set to `True`
2. **Last Contacted** → set to the task's `Completed At` date (falls back to `last_edited_time`)
3. **Meeting Booked** → set to `True` if `Call Outcome = "Meeting Scheduled"`

### Key Design Decisions

- **Auto-closed filter** — skips tasks whose `Outcome Notes` contains the string `"auto-closed"` (set by `automation/cleanup_overdue_tasks.py`). This prevents bulk-closed legacy tasks from polluting contact records.
- **Idempotent** — skips contacts that already have `Contact Responded = True` AND `Last Contacted` set, unless `--force` is passed.
- **`Call Outcome` field** — meeting detection uses the `Call Outcome` select field (not keyword heuristics). This requires the sales rep to fill in the outcome field when completing a task.
- **Explicit env var failure** — requires NOTION_API_KEY, NOTION_DATABASE_ID_TASKS, NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CONTACTS. Will raise EnvironmentError immediately if any is missing. No hardcoded fallback IDs.
- **Log rotation** — uses RotatingFileHandler (5 MB per file, 3 backups) rather than timestamped per-run files to prevent unbounded log accumulation.

### Required Env Vars (all MANDATORY — no fallbacks)

```
NOTION_API_KEY
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_TASKS
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CONTACTS
```

### Commands

```bash
python automation/outcome_tracker.py                              # dry-run (safe, no writes)
python automation/outcome_tracker.py --execute                    # apply changes
python automation/outcome_tracker.py --execute --force            # re-process already-updated contacts
python automation/outcome_tracker.py --execute --limit 20         # test with first 20 tasks
python automation/outcome_tracker.py --execute --include-auto-closed  # include bulk-closed tasks too
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always run dry-run first to confirm counts before `--execute`.

---

## automation/cleanup_overdue_tasks.py — Legacy Task Cleanup

Bulk-completes overdue auto-created tasks from pre-v5.0 contact-level Action Engine. These tasks were never actioned and are superseded by the company-level task model (v5.0). Run once after migrating to v5.0.

### Commands

```bash
python automation/cleanup_overdue_tasks.py --dry-run  # preview only
python automation/cleanup_overdue_tasks.py            # execute cleanup
python automation/cleanup_overdue_tasks.py --limit 100  # limit batch size
```

---

## automation/lead_inbox_mover.py — Lead Inbox → CRM Mover (v0.2)

Moves Qualified leads from the 📥 Lead Inbox into real Company + Contact records in the CRM. This is the bridge between Bootstrap Mode v0.1 (Lead Inbox only) and the main AI Sales OS pipeline.

### Why v0.2 (not v0.1)

v0.1 only flipped `Status = Qualified → Moved` without creating any CRM records — a cosmetic move that faked the upgrade gate. v0.2 actually creates Company and Contact records and writes back the CRM refs, so "Moved" becomes a real state.

### Modes

| Mode | Filter | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `forward` (default) | `Status = Qualified` | Process newly-qualified leads going forward |
| `backfill` | `Status = Moved AND CRM Company Ref is empty` | Retroactively create CRM records for leads that were "fake-moved" by v0.1 |
| `all` | Both above | Run forward + backfill in one pass |

### Dedup Rules

- **Company:** Domain (exact, case-insensitive, generic domains like gmail/yahoo excluded) → Name (exact match on `Company Name` title, with legal-suffix normalization) → create new
- **Contact:** Email (exact match on Contacts DB `Email` field) → create new
- **Lazy lookup:** No full preload (Contacts DB ≈ 45K). Queries run per-lead with a negative-miss cache to avoid re-querying known-missing keys in the same run.

### Fields Written Back to Lead Inbox

- `CRM Company Ref` (rich_text) — page ID of matched or created Company
- `CRM Contact Ref` (rich_text) — page ID of matched or created Contact
- `CRM Sync State` (select) — Created / Matched / Failed / Skipped
- `CRM Synced At` (date)
- `Status` → `Moved` (only on success in forward mode; backfill leaves Status untouched since it's already Moved)

### Data Quality Guards

- Invalid / pipe-separated multi-person emails (e.g. `a@x.com|b@x.com`) are stripped via regex. Original email is preserved in Notes with a `[v0.2: stripped invalid email 'X' — needs manual split]` tag. Lead falls back to phone if available.
- Missing Name, missing (email AND phone), or missing Intake Owner → lead skipped with failure reason logged.

### Required Env Vars (all mandatory — no fallbacks)

```
NOTION_API_KEY
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_LEAD_INBOX
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_COMPANIES
NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CONTACTS
```

### Commands

```bash
python automation/lead_inbox_mover.py --mode forward               # dry-run forward
python automation/lead_inbox_mover.py --mode forward --execute     # apply
python automation/lead_inbox_mover.py --mode backfill --limit 30   # batched dry-run
python automation/lead_inbox_mover.py --mode all --execute         # run both
python automation/lead_inbox_mover.py --mode backfill --verbose    # full per-lead logs
```

**Runtime:** ~12 sec per lead (lazy dedup queries + Notion rate limit). For large backfills, batch via `--limit 30` to stay under bash call timeouts.

### First Production Run — 2026-04-10 (Gate #1 Complete)

All 119 leads that had been fake-moved by v0.1 were successfully backfilled via 4 batches of `--limit 30 --execute`:

- Companies: **58 created** + **61 matched** (dedup saved us from creating 61 duplicates that already existed from Apollo sync)
- Contacts: **112 created** + **7 matched**
- Failed: **0**

Upgrade Gate #1 ("20+ leads moved from Inbox to CRM") is now met **with real records**, not just cosmetic status flips.

## governance/fix_seniority.py — Seniority Normalization Migration (One-Time)

One-time migration script to fix the `Seniority` field in Notion Contacts DB. Queries all contacts with `Seniority = "C suite"` and updates them to `"C-Suite"` to match the normalized value in `SENIORITY_NORMALIZE` (core/constants.py).

### Commands

```bash
python governance/fix_seniority.py              # dry-run — shows what would change
python governance/fix_seniority.py --execute    # apply the migration
python governance/fix_seniority.py --execute --batch-size 25  # custom batch size (default: 50)
```

**Run once only.** After execution, verify with a Notion filter that no `"C suite"` records remain.

---

## governance/audit_ownership.py — Ownership Audit

Audits ownership gaps across all 5 Notion databases (Contacts, Companies, Tasks, Meetings, Opportunities). Reports unowned or mis-assigned records. Useful for validating the v5.0 Company-Centric ownership model.

### Commands

```bash
python governance/audit_ownership.py          # full audit across all DBs
python governance/audit_ownership.py --fix    # auto-assign owners where possible
```

## pipelines/file_sync/ — Tri-Directional Sync Engine

A production-grade file synchronization module that keeps three systems in perfect sync: Local Filesystem ↔ Google Drive ↔ GitHub Repository.

### Architecture

```
Local ◄──────────────────────────────────► Google Drive
  │                                               │
  └───────────────────► GitHub ◄──────────────────┘
                           │
                    Unified Manifest
                   (source of truth)
```

### Key Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `build_manifest.py` | Creates unified manifest of all files across all 3 sources |
| `detect_conflicts.py` | Identifies files that differ between sources |
| `sync_to_drive.py` | Pushes local changes to Google Drive |
| `sync_to_github.py` | Commits and pushes changes to GitHub |
| `sync_to_local.py` | Pulls remote changes to local |
| `backup_manager.py` | Creates pre-sync backups |
| `scan_local/drive/github.py` | Source-specific scanners |

See `pipelines/file_sync/00_START_HERE.md` for full setup and usage guide.

## Apollo API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Purpose | Mode |
|----------|---------|------|
| `contacts/search` | Fetch contacts with filters | All modes |
| `accounts/search` | Fetch companies with filters | All modes |
| `organizations/job_postings` | Job posting signals | Phase 3 (planned) |
| `organizations/enrich` | Company enrichment | Phase 3 (planned) |
| `people_match` | Job change detection | Phase 3 (planned) |
| `mixed_people_api_search` | Advanced people search | Available |

---

## Signals Feasibility (from Apollo API)

| Signal | Method | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Job Postings** | Direct API endpoint | Available (Phase 3) |
| **Job Change** | Build detection via people_match + historical compare | Buildable (Phase 3) |
| **Intent Trend** | Compare intent scores between sync runs | Simple compare (Phase 3) |
| **News/Events** | No Apollo API | NOT available |
| **Email Engagement Detail** | Internal Apollo data, not exposed | NOT available |

---

## Key Decisions (Decision Log)

1. **No Middleware** — Rejected n8n, Make.com, Zapier. Pure Python + GitHub Actions.
2. **Embed Signals in Schema** — Signals stored as fields on Companies/Contacts, NOT a separate database.
3. **Triple Dedup** — Apollo ID → Email → seen_ids. Prevents duplicates even with pagination overlap.
4. **Time-Window Splitting** — Incremental uses 26-hour window (2h overlap). Dedup handles the rest.
5. **Alphabetical Partitioning** — Full mode splits A-Z + numbers to handle Apollo's 50K cap.
6. **Phase-Gated Execution** — Each phase must pass validation before proceeding.
7. **v1.1 Weights First** — Size + Seniority weighted high because Intent + Engagement data is sparse.
8. **80% COLD is Normal** — Cold Apollo data with no outreach = low scores expected. Not a bug.
9. **Safe Boolean Writing** — Only write engagement checkboxes if Apollo explicitly returns the field. Prevents overwriting manually-set True with False.
10. **Unified Constants** — All field names in core/constants.py. No hardcoded strings in individual scripts.
11. **Action Ready Gating** — 5-condition check before any task is created. Prevents tasks for DNC, bounced, churned, or contacts without contact methods.
12. **2-Job Pipeline** — Split daily_sync.yml into Job 1 (Sync/Score, 5h 50min) and Job 2 (Action/Track, 3h) to bypass GitHub Actions' 6-hour per-job limit. Stats passed via artifacts.
13. **Local Timestamp Filter** — Apollo's `contact_updated_at_range` API filter uses day-granularity and was returning all 44,877 contacts even on incremental runs. Fixed in `_fetch_with_date_filter()` with a post-fetch client-side filter using exact `updated_at >= since` comparison. Incremental runs now complete in minutes, not hours.
14. **Apollo Signals in Sync (v4.3)** — Intent Strength, Job Change Event/Date, Headcount Growth (6/12/24M), and Apollo AI fields (AI Decision, AI Qualification Status/Detail) are now extracted directly from contact/account responses during core/daily_sync.py. No separate enrichment scripts needed — signals flow with the regular sync.
15. **Apollo AI Custom Field IDs** — Apollo's AI generates typed_custom_fields with fixed IDs: Contact Decision (`6913a64c52c2780001146ce9`), Account ICP Analysis (`6913a64c52c2780001146cfd`), Account Research (`6913a64c52c2780001146d0e`), Account Qualification (`6913a64c52c2780001146d22`). IDs are stored in core/constants.py for maintainability.
16. **Owner & Outreach Gating (v4.4)** — Contacts must have an Apollo `owner_id` AND at least one non-failed email campaign before being synced to Notion. This prevents unowned or untouched contacts from cluttering the CRM. Existing contacts that don't meet criteria are archived (Stage = "Archived") via `governance/archive_unqualified.py`.
17. **Company Owners from Contacts (v4.4)** — Instead of relying on Apollo's Account `owner_id` (which is null for most accounts), Company Owners is derived automatically from Contact Owners. This creates a multi-select field showing all team members who own contacts at that company.
18. **Company-Centric Operating Model (v5.0)** — Company = Primary Operating Entity. All automation operates at the company level: ONE task per company per tier (automation/auto_tasks.py v2.0), ONE active opportunity per company (meetings/opportunity_manager.py v2.0). Primary Company Owner = owner with most contacts (tie-break: most recent activity). Company Stage state machine: Prospect → Outreach → Engaged → Meeting → Opportunity → Customer → Churned → Archived. Higher-priority stages are never overwritten by lower ones.
19. **Company-Level Task Dedup (v5.0)** — Tasks are deduplicated by Company + Task Type, not by Contact. All contacts at a company are listed in the task context. Task Owner cascades: Primary Company Owner → Contact Owner fallback.
20. **Meeting-to-Company Auto-Linking (v5.0)** — meetings/meeting_tracker.py v2.0 auto-resolves Company from Contact's company relation when meetings lack a direct Company link. Propagates Company Stage → "Meeting" (respects priority). Assigns Meeting Owner from Primary Company Owner.
21. **HOT vs WARM Task Type Separation (v5.1 Fix)** — HOT uses task_type = "Urgent Call", WARM uses "Follow-up". These must be distinct because company-level dedup checks by task_type — if both used "Follow-up", a company with an open WARM task would be blocked from receiving a HOT urgent-call task, defeating the priority system.
22. **Bulk Company Owner Preload (v5.1 Fix)** — automation/auto_tasks.py now preloads all company owner data in one query before the task-creation loop. Eliminates N+1 API pattern (was: 1 API call per company; now: 1 query for all companies).
23. **No Hardcoded Notion IDs** — automation/outcome_tracker.py was updated to require env vars explicitly (NOTION_DATABASE_ID_TASKS, NOTION_DATABASE_ID_CONTACTS) rather than using hardcoded fallback IDs. Fails loudly if env vars are missing.
24. **Rotating Log Files** — automation/outcome_tracker.py uses RotatingFileHandler (5 MB, 3 backups) instead of timestamped per-run log files to prevent unbounded accumulation.
25. **Modular Architecture (v6.0)** — Restructured from flat `💻 CODE/Phase 3 - Sync/` to 8-module modular structure: core, scoring, automation, governance, enrichment, meetings, monitoring, webhooks. Each module groups related scripts by function domain, improving maintainability and testability.
26. **AI Sales Actions Sync (2026-04-11)** — Apollo exposes the "AI Sales Actions" directive block (Segment/Fit/Priority/Urgency/Signal/Pain/Target Role/Action/Tone/Call Hook/Email) as a typed_custom_field on accounts, ID `69d979efebf741000dfbce23` (verified via `apollo_mixed_companies_search` on KAFD, stc). `scripts/core/daily_sync.py` now extracts this field in the account transform (same place as AI Qualification Status/Detail) and writes it as rich_text to the Companies DB `AI Sales Actions` property. Safe-write: only writes when non-empty, never blanks existing values. Downstream parser `scripts/core/ai_sales_actions_parser.py` + enricher `scripts/enrichment/ai_sales_actions_enricher.py` consume this field to populate sub-fields (AI Priority, AI Fit, AI Tone, AI Call Hook, etc.). Closes the gap where Notion showed 0 companies with AI Sales Actions populated despite the field being present in Apollo.
27. **Apollo Account Owner Priority (v5.1 — 2026-04-11)** — Reverses Decision #17 for the specific case where the Apollo Account itself has an `owner_id`. New priority in `compute_company_ownership()`: **(1)** Apollo Account `owner_id` (mapped via `APOLLO_OWNER_MAP`) wins directly → becomes Primary Company Owner, Supporting Owners cleared (Apollo is authoritative). **(2)** Only if Apollo owner is missing or unmapped, fall back to v5.0 contact-based derivation (owner with most contacts, tie-break by most recent activity). Why: for accounts that Apollo has explicitly assigned, the human assignment is more authoritative than a statistical head-count of contact owners. Decision #17 still holds as the fallback path. Implementation passes `accounts` (raw Apollo batch) to `compute_company_ownership()` from all three mode runners (`run_incremental`, `run_backfill`, `run_full`); the function builds an `account_id → owner_id` map and iterates over the union of Apollo-owned and contact-owned accounts. Logging: `[Ownership] Using Apollo owner for company X` / `[Ownership] Fallback to contact-based ownership for company Y` / warning on unmapped Apollo `owner_id`. Final stats line reports `apollo=N, fallback=M, unmapped_apollo=U, skipped=S`. No schema changes. No impact on dedup, metrics, stage, contact sync, or downstream task ownership.
28. **Real Intent Definition + Archive Guard (v6.1 — 2026-04-11)** — Broadened the intent signal beyond the old narrow `ENGAGEMENT_SIGNALS = {email_open, replied, meeting_booked, demoed}` set, which produced false negatives (single open = no signal). New definition centralized in `scripts/core/constants.py::has_real_intent(record)` and `company_has_real_intent(contacts)`: `intent = replied OR meeting_booked OR email_open_count >= 2 OR internal_forward_detected OR forward_count > 0 OR unique_openers_count >= 2 OR repeated_engagement_detected`. Returns `(bool, [reasons])` for logging. Accepts both snake_case (Apollo) and Title Case (Notion) keys. **Applied in:** (a) `governance/ingestion_gate.py::_check_engagement()` — renamed criterion to "Intent Signal"; (b) `governance/data_governor.py` — Archive Guard: any company/contact with real intent is spared from archival even if other soft failures exist (hard failures like no_company/no_email still archive contacts); (c) `core/daily_sync.py::compute_company_stage()` — contacts with real intent drive stage → Engaged; (d) `enrichment/analytics_tracker.py` — writes `Internal Forward Detected` and `Repeated Engagement Detected` booleans. Principle: *"repeated opens + internal circulation = meaningful commercial signal; not replying does not mean no interest."* Apollo limitation: no explicit "forwarded" field — `email_open_count >= 2` is the primary proxy, `unique_openers_count` / `forward_count` used when available.
29. **Safe Execution Order + Conflict Guards (v6.1 — 2026-04-11)** — Pipeline ordering was previously making decisions before their data existed: `analytics_tracker` and `outcome_tracker` ran in Job 2 AFTER `lead_score` in Job 1, so every scoring pass read yesterday's engagement data. `data_governor` could archive companies whose fresh signals hadn't landed yet. `daily_sync.compute_company_stage` and `opportunity_manager.update_company_stage_to_opportunity` both wrote Company Stage unconditionally, regressing Customer/Churned stages. **Fixes:** (a) **Reordered `.github/workflows/daily_sync.yml`** — moved `analytics_tracker`, `outcome_tracker`, `meeting_tracker`, `opportunity_manager` from Job 2 into Job 1 BEFORE `lead_score` + `action_ready_updater`. New Job 1 order: daily_sync → analytics_tracker → outcome_tracker → meeting_tracker → opportunity_manager → job_postings_enricher → lead_score → action_ready_updater → upload stats. Job 2 is now: auto_tasks → auto_sequence → meeting_analyzer (AI, non-blocking) → health_check. (b) **Added `STAGE_PRIORITY` lattice + `STAGE_TERMINAL` + `is_stage_regression()` to `core/constants.py`** — priority: Prospect(1) → Outreach(2) → Engaged(3) → Meeting(4) → Opportunity(5) → Customer(6) → Churned(7) → Archived(8). Terminal = {Customer, Churned, Archived}. (c) **Stage Write Guards** — `daily_sync.compute_company_stage()` and `opportunity_manager.update_company_stage_to_opportunity()` now read current stage BEFORE writing, skip if terminal, skip if regression, skip no-ops. `meeting_tracker.update_company_stage_to_meeting()` already had a compatible guard — left untouched. Uniform logging: `[Conflict Guard] Skipping stage write for X: current 'Customer' is terminal` / `[Conflict Guard] Prevented stage regression for X: Meeting → Outreach`. Final stats line in `compute_company_stage`: `N updated, R regressions prevented, T terminal stages preserved`. (d) **Freshness Guard in `data_governor`** — added `check_pipeline_freshness()` + `FRESHNESS_STATS_FILES = (enrichment/last_analytics_stats.json, automation/last_outcome_stats.json, meetings/last_meeting_tracker_stats.json)` + `FRESHNESS_MAX_AGE_HOURS = 26` to `core/constants.py`. `DataGovernor.run()` checks freshness as Step 0. If stats are older than 26h (or missing), enforce mode auto-downgrades to dry-run and logs `[Timing Guard] Refusing to archive on possibly-stale engagement data`. (e) **Artifact upload in Job 1 expanded** to include analytics, outcome, meeting_tracker, and opportunity stats/logs so next day's freshness check has real data. **Single-writer rule** for Company Stage: four writers (daily_sync, meeting_tracker, opportunity_manager, data_governor), all now guarded by `STAGE_TERMINAL` + `is_stage_regression`. No schema changes. First post-deploy run will see stale freshness (by design — no prior stats files); from run 2 onward enforcement resumes normally.
